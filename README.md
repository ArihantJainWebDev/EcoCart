# 🌿 EcoCart – Sustainable Shopping Made Easy

EcoCart is a browser extension + dashboard that empowers users to make **eco-conscious shopping decisions** by analyzing products and assigning them a real-time **Eco Score** out of 100.

Most online shoppers are unaware of the environmental impact of the products they buy. Many items contain harmful packaging materials, excessive carbon footprints, and toxic chemicals. **EcoCart** bridges this gap by automatically scanning product pages and presenting users with a simple, transparent sustainability score.
